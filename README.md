# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is Where I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and more to create simple websites during my course.

# Projects

# All Things Welsh
This is where I used Bootstrap to give my website the small details and finishes.

# Poke Squad
This is where I used CSS to design a website for the Pokemon fan world, for collectors, the chasers and anyone wanting to keep up to date on a streamers content.

# My Portfolio
This is where a more professional look was given to show my skills aquired during my course.

Within these are also small tasks that challenged my knowledge of the subjects I have worked on, such as:
- Effecting Images with CSS
- Trial with Javascript
- Small sample websites that showed simple yet overall understanding of each task.
